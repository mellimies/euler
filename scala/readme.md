# Scala Euler

This repo is my attempt to get familiar with Scala and functional programming.

A few years ago I tried solving Project Euler with python and the tools familiar
to me but another go with Scala and FP. Python2 code is its own directory, contains
many files that do not return correct result yet.

Anyway, this Scala code should run straight from IntelliJ IDE.
