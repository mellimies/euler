  * Problem 22
  * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
  * a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
  * begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
  * Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
  * multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list
  * to obtain a name score.
  *
  * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
  * COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
  * is the 938th name in the list.
  * So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
  *
  * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
